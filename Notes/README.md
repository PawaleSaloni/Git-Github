# 1️⃣ What is Git?

Git is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** used to track changes in source code during software development.

It helps developers:

- Track changes in files  
- Maintain project history  
- Work collaboratively in teams  
- Revert mistakes safely  
- Manage multiple versions of a project  

Git is an industry-standard tool used in almost every software company.
